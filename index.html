<p>DaltonLens aims at simplifying the life of color blind people with utility software and technical blog posts.</p>

<h1 id="software">Software</h1>

<h3 id="daltonlens-for-desktop"><a href="https://github.com/DaltonLens/DaltonLens">DaltonLens for Desktop</a></h3>

<p>Utility for macOS, Windows and Linux. It runs as a tray program, always at your
fingertip with a global Ctrl+Alt+Win+Space shortcut. It can then show color
information below the pointer, capture a screen area and apply a range of color
filters on it. It also has a tool to highlight pixels with similar colors which
is especially useful to read color-coded charts and plots.</p>

<h3 id="online-color-blindness-simulator"><a href="colorblindness-simulator">Online Color Blindness Simulator</a></h3>

<p>An extensive comparison of color blindness simulation methods, right in the
browser. Use the predefined images or upload your own. It is based on the
careful implementations of DaltonLens-Python. Also check the related <a href="/opensource-cvd-simulation/">Review of
Open Source Color Blindness Simulations</a>.</p>

<h3 id="daltonlens-python"><a href="https://github.com/DaltonLens/DaltonLens-Python">DaltonLens-Python</a></h3>

<p>Toolbox for research and development on color vision deficiency algorithms. It
includes various implementations of color blindness simulators and tools to
generate Ishihara-like plates and visualize confusion lines. It is used to
create the technical posts as Jupyter notebooks and tries to match the color
perception theory as accurately as possible.</p>

<h3 id="libdaltonlens"><a href="https://github.com/DaltonLens/libDaltonLens">libDaltonLens</a></h3>

<p>Single-file, public domain C library implementing some reference color vision deficiency
simulation algorithms. It is meant to be easily copied/adapted.</p>
