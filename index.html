DaltonLens aims at simplifying the life of color blind people with utility software and technical blog posts.

# Software

### [DaltonLens for Desktop](https://github.com/DaltonLens/DaltonLens)

Utility for macOS, Windows and Linux. It runs as a tray program, always at your
fingertip with a global Ctrl+Alt+Win+Space shortcut. It can then show color
information below the pointer, capture a screen area and apply a range of color
filters on it. It also has a tool to highlight pixels with similar colors which
is especially useful to read color-coded charts and plots.
- Last update: v2.3 (November 9, 2021)

### [Online Color Blindness Simulator](colorblindness-simulator)

An extensive comparison of color blindness simulation methods, right in the
browser. Use the predefined images or upload your own. It is based on the
careful implementations of DaltonLens-Python. Also check the related [Review of
Open Source Color Blindness Simulations](/opensource-cvd-simulation/).

### [DaltonLens-Python](https://github.com/DaltonLens/DaltonLens-Python)

Toolbox for research and development on color vision deficiency algorithms. It
includes various implementations of color blindness simulators and tools to
generate Ishihara-like plates and visualize confusion lines. It is used to
create the technical posts as Jupyter notebooks and tries to match the color
perception theory as accurately as possible.

### [libDaltonLens](https://github.com/DaltonLens/libDaltonLens)

Single-file, public domain C library implementing some reference color vision deficiency
simulation algorithms. It is meant to be easily copied/adapted.
