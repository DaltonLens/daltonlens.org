DaltonLens aims at simplifying the life of color blind people with utility software and technical blog posts:

- [DaltonLens for Desktop](https://github.com/DaltonLens/DaltonLens) is a
utility for macOS, Windows and Linux. It runs as a tray program, always at your
fingertip with a global Ctrl+Alt+Win+Space shortcut. It can then show color
information below the pointer, capture a screen area and apply a range of color
filters on it. It also has a tool to highlight pixels with similar colors which
is especially useful to read color-coded charts and plots.
    - Last update: v2.3 (November 9, 2021)
    - [Download for Windows](https://github.com/DaltonLens/DaltonLens/releases/download/release%2F2.3/DaltonLens-2.3-win64.exe). *Warning*: on Windows 10 you'll need to click on `More Info` / `Run Anyway` to bypass Windows protection against unknown binaries.
    - [Download on the mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dalton-lens/id1222737651)
    - [Download for Linux](https://github.com/DaltonLens/DaltonLens/releases)

- [DaltonLens-Python](https://github.com/DaltonLens/DaltonLens-Python) is a
toolbox for research and development on color vision deficiency algorithms. It
includes a color blindness simulator and tools to generate Ishihara-like plates
and visualize confusion lines.

- [libDaltonLens](https://github.com/DaltonLens/libDaltonLens) is a single-file,
public domain C library implementing some reference color vision deficiency
simulation algorithms. It is meant to be easily copied/adapted.

These are developed by [Nicolas Burrus](http://nicolas.burrus.name) as a hobby
project to make his protan life easier :-)
