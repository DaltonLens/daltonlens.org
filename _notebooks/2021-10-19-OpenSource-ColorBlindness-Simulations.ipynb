    "## Why simulate color vision deficiencies (CVD)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Color vision deficiencies (CVD), commonly called \"color blindness\" affects ~8% of the male population and ~0.4% of the female population. Being able to accurately simulate them is important for several reasons:\n",
    "- Communicate about this issue and help other people understand it\n",
    "- Help designers choose color schemes that everyone will perceive\n",
    "- Create tools to enhance images and help color blind people in their daily tasks. Most correction tools start by simulating how a person with CVD would see the image, and then find some way to spread the lost information into the channels that are better perceived or playing with the light intensity to restore the contrast.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many online resources to understand CVD in detail. The [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness), [color-blindness.com](https://color-blindness.com/) and the [chroma-phobe youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Chromaphobe/videos) are a good start, but here are some key facts to follow this article:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Human color perception is achieved via cone cells in the retina. Humans with normal vision have 3 kinds of cells, sensitive to different light wavelengths. L cones capture Long-wavelength (\\~red), M cones capture Medium-wavelength (\\~green) and S cones capture Short-wavelength (\\~blue). Their response over the light spectrum is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Cone_spectral_sensitivities.png \"LMS Response over the light wavelength (from Wikipedia). L is roughly centered on red, M on green and S on blue. Note that the responses overlap significantly, especially for the L and M cones.\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most color vision deficiencies can be explained by one type of cone cells not behaving properly. Protanopes, deuteranopes and tritanopes respectively lack or have malfunctioning L, M, or S cone cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CVD simulations based on physiological experiments generally consists in transforming the image to a color space where the influence of each kind of cone cells is explicit and can be decreased or removed easily. The [LMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LMS_color_space) color space was designed to specifically match the human cone responses and is thus the choice of the vast majority of methods. So the typical pipeline consists in transforming the RGB image into LMS, applying the simulation there, and going back to RGB."

    "## Making sense of the available models and programs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many methods to simulate color blindness, and we can easily find lots of open source programs to do so. However color perception theory is complex and most well-intentioned developers (like me!) end up copying existing algorithms without having a solid understanding of where they come from and which ones are best. It is also difficult to evaluate the accuracy of the simulations, so very bad simulations can still appear reasonable to an untrained observer.\n",
    "\n",
    "While developing [DaltonLens](daltonlens.org) I got frustrated by this as I was trying to decide which method I should implement. And being a mild-protan myself, I was often not very convinced by the results of existing methods as they tended to make the simulated images way too exaggerated. But for the first version I had little time and copy/pasted some code for the daltonize filters, which turned out to be quite wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I've decided to dig further into the history of the available algorithms and try to understand where they come from and how much we can trust them."

    "As it can get confusing, here is a summary of the main terms to describe CVD variants:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Dichromacy* refers to one kind of cone cells fully missing. The corresponding deficiencies for each kind are called *protanopia*, *deuteranopia* and *tritanopia*. The color space of people with dichromacy (*dichromats*) is basically 2D instead of 3D.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Anomalous trichromacy* refers to having one kind of cone cells with only a partial disfunction (e.g less density or with a shifted wavelength peak). The corresponding deficiencies are called *protanomaly*, *deuteranomaly* and *tritanomaly*. In software simulations the degree of severity is usually encoded as a float value between 0 (no deficiency) and 1 (dichromacy).\n",
    "\n",
    "- A *protan* or a *protanope* is a person suffering from protanopia (\"strong\" protan) or protanomaly (\"mild\" protan). *Deutan/deuteranope* and *tritan/tritanope* are defined similarly."

    "## Coblis and the HCIRN Color Blind Simulation function\n",
    "\n",
    "A google search for \"color blindness simulation\" first returns [color-blindness.com](https://color-blindness.com/). I mentioned that website before because it has great introductory material, but it also proposes a CVD simulator, called *Coblis*. Being one of the oldest and easiest tool to test it has inspired lots of other software. But digging into the history of the code is interesting and shows that its accuracy is questionable, especially in the older version.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulator now relies on the source code of [MaPePeR](https://github.com/MaPePeR/jsColorblindSimulator). It implements two different functions, one based on the \"Color-Matrix\" algorithm (Coblis v1), and one based on the \"HCIRN Color Blind Simulation function\" (Coblis v2, the default as of October 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Color-Matrix\" algorithm was developed by [www.colorjack.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014161121/http://www.colorjack.com/labs/colormatrix/). He converted the \"HCIRN Color Blind Simulation function\" that works in the CIE-XYZ color-space into a faster matrix that directly works on RGB values (that kind of optimization mattered back then). He did so by running the full function on 3 RGB values (pure red, pure green, pure blue) to deduce the 3x3 transformation matrices. So this approach only ensures the equivalence for these 3 colors. It also ignores the non-linearity of sRGB images, which was approximately handled in the original code with a gamma function (more about sRGB in a followup post). The author himself later said that this was a one-night hack and that nobody should use it anymore in a [comment on kaioa.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20111123145815/http://kaioa.com/node/75#comment-247):\n",
    "> You're right, the ColorMatrix version is very simplified, and not accurate. I created that color matrix one night (http://www.colorjack.com/labs/colormatrix/) and since then it's shown up many places... I should probably take that page down before it spreads more! Anyways, it gives you an idea of what it might look like, but for the real thing...\n",
    "\n",
    "The author actually took down that page since then, but it's hard to stop the spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the proper \"HCIRN Color Blind Simulation function\", the first public code was developed by [Matthew Wickline](http://colorlab.wickline.org/colorblind/colorlab/docs/acknowledgments.html) and made available as a javascript [Color Blindness Library](https://web.archive.org/web/20071012020140/http://www.nofunc.com/Color_Blindness_Library/). The author says in the [acknowledgments](http://colorlab.wickline.org/colorblind/colorlab/docs/acknowledgments.html) that he wrote it by adapting some Java code that he got from Thomas Wolfmaier after reading his 1999 article [Designing for the Color-Challenged: A Challenge](https://web.archive.org/web/20071212234539/http://www.internettg.org/newsletter/mar99/accessibility_color_challenged.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "This article explains that they implemented a method based on the seminal work of {% cite meyer_color_defective_1988 %}, who was the first to propose an actual algorithm to simulate CVD, in the CIE XYZ color space. However the implementation of Thomas Wolfmaier was not validated experimentally:\n",
    "> Has the model been validated on individuals with color vision deficiencies? Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to test the model. We did apply the model to some of the tables of the UMIST 'For Fun' Colour Vision Test and were able to reproduce the predicted confusions. If you have some form of color vision deficiency, please have a look at the design aids described in the following sections and let us know how well the model predicts the color you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "> How accurate is the model? The model provides only a rough approximation. It includes estimates for some properties of color vision defects as well as assumptions about the hardware on which the colors are displayed. It also does not account for the reduced sensitivity to reds of individuals with protan defects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that {% cite meyer_color_defective_1988 %} did some experimental validation, where they noted that dichromats responded favorably to the simulations, despite some issues with highly saturated colors. {% cite vienot_digital_1999 %} later commented that working in the CIE XYZ color space is worse as it does not take into account the altered perception of luminosity for dichromats."

    "{% cite vienot_digital_1999 %} builds on the Brettel 1997 paper. In a nutshell it simplifies the math and adapts it for digital displays. It has become a very popular reference, in large part thanks to the daltonize algorithm of {% cite fidaner_analysis_2005 %}. That daltonize algorithm aims at improving the color contrasts of a given image for a person with CVD. The first step is to simulate how the image is seen by a dichromat, and then distribute the error w.r.t the original image on the other color channels. That algorithm became very popular and got copy/pasted/adapted many times. Since it used the simulation algorithm of Viénot 1999 in the first step, this approach has become popular along the way too.\n",

    "For protanopia and deuteranopia the results are reasonably similar between Viénot 1999 and Brettel 1997, so the faster one can be preferred. But again the Viénot paper is not well adapted to tritanopia. The authors themselves only refer to protanopia and deuteranopia in it. In the best case it's just not accurate, but as [this article on ixora.io](https://ixora.io/projects/colorblindness/color-blindness-simulation-research/) points out, it can even be totally wrong if the red-green projection plane is kept for tritanopia, which happens frequently.\n",

It's in C, with zero dependencies, and unit tested against reference implementations. [DaltonLens for desktop](https://github.com/DaltonLens/DaltonLens/blob/master/Dalton/OpenGL_Shaders.cpp) has an OpenGL version of that code, and [DaltonLens-Python](https://github.com/DaltonLens/DaltonLens-Python) has unit-tested implementations of the 3 methods discussed above.

    "# How accurate are these simulations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Brettel 1997, Viénot 1999 and Machado 2009 have a fairly solid theoretical background, but they still remain approximate mathematical models of the complex human perception of colors. So how good are they at simulating how a person with CVD perceives colors? Several studies have attempted to validate these experimentally. A first step is to ask a person with CVD to validate whether the original image and the simulated image look similar, which is what Brettel 1997 did. More elaborate studies compared how people with CVD and people with normal vision perform on color tests or color-related tasks. On the original images people with normal vision are expected to perform better, but when given the simulated images they should perform similarly as the people with the corresponding CVD, if the simulatation is accurate. {% cite simon_liedtke_using_2016 %} show that the Brettel model is pretty good at least for deuteranopes, and {% cite machado_physiologically_based_2009 %} showed pretty good results for protanopes and deuteranopes for their method, which is similar to the Brettel one for full dichromacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are still some serious limits though, so all these models have to be taken with a grain of salt:\n",
    "\n",
    "- So far we've mostly discussed dichromacy, where one kind of cone is entirely missing. But most people actually have anomalous trichromacy, where the deficient cones are still either present but with less density, or shifted towards another cone, limiting its discriminative power. For those the dichromat models will look too extreme as they can perceive more colors and see a difference between the original and simulated images.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All these models are based on _average_ observers. But there are great individual variations. For example Brettel 1997 noted that some experiments on 4 deuteranopes showed that two had a spectral peak of 558 nm for two of them, and 563nm for the other two. So ideally the parameters of the models would need to get adjusted for each person.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These models assumed that only the lowest level of color perception is affected, and ignore the plasticity of the brain that can potentially adapt and change the color perception at higher levels. These simulations do not model anything like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The validation experiments are generally made on a very small population, rarely more than 10 people. And tritanopes are basically never evaluated since they are very rare and hard to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most people will look at these simulations on an uncalibrated computer screen in a room with some kind of background illumination. Without a proper calibration of the monitor the stimuli that corresponds to each sRGB value will be inaccurate, and the background illumination may be far from the expected D65 (normal outdoor). Also the brightness, contrast and color balance settings of the monitor can significantly change the color appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- {% cite meyer_color_defective_1988 %} noted that the size of the field of view can affect the severity of an individual's deficiency. They refer to {% cite pokorny_new_1982 %} that observed how the severity can decrease as the field of view increases. This explains why colors are harder to identify for a person with CVD on small objects like LEDs, but easier on large bright objects. Ideally the simulations should take that into account and preserve more of the original color on large objects."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "So the good news is that there are quite a few solutions to simulate CVDs. The bad news is there is still a lot of outdated code out, and even for well-intentioned developers it's quite hard to evaluate whether the output of their simulation is correct or not, so I hope that this article can help.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second issue is that the methods that are easy to implement are generic and were developed from experimental data collected on average observers (and a long time ago!). We're still lacking a great practical way to model individual color vision deficiency profiles and feed that into a simulator. The work of {% cite flatla_so_2012 %} and {% cite macalpine_real_time_2016 %} goes in that direction, but as far as I know there is no open source code for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also other research work that have remained more confidential so far like {% cite capilla_corresponding_pair_2004 %}. While interesting, the main problem here again is that no large-scale validation was performed, so it's hard to know which one is better. That group also did share [some Matlab code](http://rua.ua.es/dspace/handle/10045/23471), but it hasn't been maintained and can't be run without a Matlab runtime from 2011.\n",
